# 🧠 AI + Frontend Project Ideas

Welcome to my personal collection of project ideas that combine **Artificial Intelligence** with **Frontend Development**.  
As a frontend engineer, I’m exploring ways to integrate AI tools like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and Hugging Face into engaging and useful web apps using **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.

This repo serves as a notebook of inspirations, learning paths, and ready-to-build ideas. Feel free to use them, remix them, or contribute new ones!

With the rise of LLMs and AI APIs, frontend developers now have access to powerful tools that were once reserved for data scientists. My goal is to:
- Document interesting AI-powered app ideas
